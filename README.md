Webpeggiator
========

My [MIDIHACK DAY](http://www.midihack.com) submission.
[Webpeggiator](http://www.hackathon.io/webpeggiator) - A Distributed Arpeggiator
Using Web MIDI API, Web Audio API and WebRTC, I can use all the connected computers as potential speakers. 
In simple words, I play an arpeggiator using Ableton Live, I route the MIDI info to my browser and using peer to peer connections. 
It randomly selects a device on each note and generates sounds on it.

Libraries:
[Peer.js](http://peerjs.com/)
